For a long time I have been using the `unittest` module to test my Python
packages. However, today I found that Spacemacs' `python` layer does not provide
utility directly working with it. The `python` layer do work with `nose` and
`pytest` however. The latter is sound familiar to me. I decided to give it a try.

The installation is the usual way.

```bash
$ pip install pytest
```

The unit test is much easier to write with `pytest`, I no longer need to create
a `unittest.TestCase` class and make a `setUp` method storing repeated-used
objects. This functionality is provided by another more sophisticated feature
`fixture` in `pytest`.

The `pytest` module can auto detect tests according to the
[standard test discovery rules](http://pytest.org/latest/goodpractices.html#test-discovery).
We can embed tests into the implementation code, such as the following code in
the file `foo.py`.

```python
def foo(n):
    return n + 1

def test_foo():
    assert 1 == f(0)
    assert 2 == f(1)
```

Then we can run `python -m pytest foo.py`. The test would performed
automatically. It speeds up the development of ad hoc scripting a lot.
