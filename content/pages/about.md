Title: About
Date: 2015-05-11

welcome to my blog. This blog mainly focusses on things I am interested in.

## Me

I am a postgraduate student who is majoring in Economics
but interested in programming and fascinated by Mathematics
(though not good at it).

## This Site

I built this site for learning. I am a bad learner. Without writing down notes,
I couldn't focus.

At first I decided to use *Nikola* as static pages generator. However, I failed
to set up it correctly on my pc. *Pelican* is the only choice left for me.

The theme of this site is based on 
[cebong](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/cebong).
I tweaked this theme to support 
[pandoc-reader](https://github.com/liob/pandoc_reader), including
[mathjax](http://www.mathjax.org) for math notation and some css for code highlighting.

To make this site available in China, I replaced some google services and cdn
with mirrors in China.
