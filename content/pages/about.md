Title: About
Date: 2015-05-11

Welcome to my blog. This blog mainly focusses on things I am interested in:

* Economics which is my ideal career;
* Mathematics by which economists describe the world;
* Programming by which economists analyze the world.

## This Site

I built this site for learning. I am a bad learner. Without writing down notes,
I cannot focus.

The theme used in this website is called 'cloud'. My original goal is to make it
simple and elegant, simple as black-white, elegant as velvet sky. I
intentionally remove any distractions in the design, keep the content
outstanding, but at the same time try to retain details as much as possible.

Some entries in this blog are much ill-formed, because those blog uses `mathjax`
to render math expressions, and after a huge redesign, I decided not to use that
any more. The legacy pages remain broken ever since, and I have no plan to fix
it. Then, I keep math heavily involved entry in PDF file written by LaTeX. The
maintenance is simplified, thus life levitated.
