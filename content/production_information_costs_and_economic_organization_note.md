This week we will discuss paper
*Production, Information Costs, and Economic Organization* which is written
by Alchian and Demsetz and important for the study of firm.

I think it mainly answered three questions.

* Wherein is the relationship between a grocer and his employee different from
that between a grocer and his customers?
* How different types of firms deal with the way of surveillance for sloth.
* What makes some kinds of inputs owned by the firm and others by employee.

## Character of the Firm

The paper first argues that the common conception about the difference between
the market and the firm. It is commonly known to us that the firm is characterized
by the power to settle issues by fiat, by authority, or by disciplinary action
superior to that available in the conventional market.

However, this paper disagree.

> This is delusion. The firm does not own all its inputs. It has no power of fiat,
no authority, no disciplinary action any different in the slightest degree from
ordinary market contracting between any two people.

They argued

> To speak of managing, directing, or assigning workers to various tasks is a
deceptive way of noting that the employer continually is involved in renegotiation
of contracts on terms that must be acceptable to both parties. Telling an employee
to type this letter rather than to file that document is like my telling a grocer
to sell me this brand of tuna rather than that brand of bread.

Alchian and Demsetz denied the propriety of the cognition that the different
between the firm and the market is that the former operates by fiat, by authority,
or by disciplinary action, but the latter is lack of all these powers. They thought
the essential difference is that there is a centralized position of some party
in the contractual arrangements in the firm.

## Why the Firm Operates This Way

The main purpose of the centralized position in the contractual arrangements is
to deal with the metering problem in team production.

Out of the need to product collectively in a team, which will promote productivity
a lot at some cases, a team must decrease the degree of sloth of their members
at the cost of some payments on surveillance.

In principle, market competition can force the members in a team to do their
best, because there are some potential members out of the team can replace the
shirking members.

However, market competition has its drawback.

* First, by definition, the detection of shirking by observing team output is
costly for team production.
* Second, the person who entered the team has no less incentive than the one
whom he/she has replaced to shirk.

Another way to detecting shirking is for someone to specialize as a monitor to
checking the input performance of team members.

However, the monitor has the same incentive to shirk as the others have. If owners
of cooperating inputs agree with the monitor that he is to receive any residual
product above prescribed amounts, the monitor will have an added incentive not
to shirk.

The monitor must have some right to punish the members who shirk, or the monitor
cannot reduce shirking at all. To discipline team members, the residual claimant
have power to revise the contract terms and incentives of individual members
without having to terminate or alter every other input's contract.

The centralized position in the contractual arrangements have established.


## Types of Firms

There are a lot of firms, but not all of them can handle the problem of team
production very well.

Profit-sharing can be functional in firms of small scale, but can hardly fit in
large team production, because members are more prone to shirk in a larger team
since their parts responsible for losses are smaller.

To speak of the corporation, large numbers of corporate stockholders cause shirking
problem. Some stockholder can make little effort to manage the corporation but
receive revenues from other partners' exertion. More effective control of corporate
activity is achieved by transferring decision authority to a smaller group, whose
main function is to negotiate with and manage the other inputs of a team.

## Kinds of Inputs Owned by the Firm

In a firm, some inputs are owned by employer and some other owned by employee.
What is the decisive factor dividing some parts of inputs to one, some parts to
another.

First, owner-employer must convince others he has the ability to cover all potential
losses to pay prescribed profits.

> He can pay in advance or he can commit wealth sufficient to cover negative
residuals. The latter will take the form of machines, land, buildings, or raw
materials committed to the firm.

And when a durable resource is used it will have a marginal product and
a depreciation. Its use requires payment to cover at least use-induced depreciation.
When one use his own property, he usually will take care of the resource.
However, when one use resources belonging to others, he may become careless of
them.

So the owner-employer must have inputs in a firm.

But there are opposite forces making renting more economical than ownership.

> The factor with which we are concerned here is one related to the costs of
monitoring not only the gross product performance of an input but alse the abuse
or depreciation inflicted on the input in the course of its use.

Resources whose user cost is harder to detect when used by someone else tend to
be owner-used. If depreciation or user cost is more cheaply detected when the
owner can see its use than by only seeing the input before and after, there is
force toward owner use rather than renting.

## Another Reason That Firms Exist

The firm can function as a surrogate market. The owner-eomployer can collect
much more information about the productivity of his members than the market do.

Those who work as employees or who rent services to him are using him to discern
superior combinations of inputs. By this way, firms benefit all.

## Afterword

I feel timid about my notes on this paper, because I spared many lines of
content without digging and fill the gap between the paper's main topic
and the authors' formulation with my own thoughts which are prone to
be erroneous.

Thanks.
