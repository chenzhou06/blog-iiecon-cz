Suppose we want to choose a consumption path to optimize the utility of our
entire life, however consumption affects our utility in two different
ways. Consumption would increase our instantaneous utility but decreases our
savings so that our future utility may decline.

Our object is to choose a series of consumption which ultimately maximize the
utility of our entire life. This kind of problem involves a state variable
(savings) and a control variable (consumption). Here is an example[^1] about
life-cycle savings

[^1]: This example is adopted from
	[here](http://web.stanford.edu/~pkurlat/teaching/14%20-%20Continuous%20Time.pdf).

-   State variable: wealth $a$;
-   Control variable: consumption $c$;
-   Wage function: $w(t)$ and the path of gross interest rates $R(t)$,
	where $t$ denotes time;
-   $T$: total life time;
-   Constraint: $$\dot{a}(t) = (R(t) - 1) a(t) + w(t) - c(t);$$
-   Payoff function $$r(t, a(t), c(t)) = e^{-\rho t} u(c(t));$$
-   Terminal value
	-   $g(x_{T}) = 0$ and the constraint $x_{T} \ge 0$,
	-   $g(x_T)$ increasing.

More generally a dynamic optimization problem can be stated as
$$\begin{gathered} V(x_0, 0) \equiv \max_{x(t), \alpha(t)} \int_0^T r(t, x(t),
\alpha(t))dt
  + g(x(T)) \\ \text{s.t.}\ \dot{x}(t) = f(t,x(t), \alpha(t)); \quad x_0 \text{
  given}.\end{gathered}$$ where $x$ is a state variable, $\alpha$ is a control
  variable, $r$ is an instantaneous payoff function, $g$ is a terminal value.

To solve this problem we need help from Hamiltonian function
$$H(t,x,\alpha,\lambda) \equiv r(t,x,\alpha) + \lambda f(t,x,\alpha).$$
The solution must satisfy $$\begin{gathered}
  \frac{\partial H(t,x(t), \alpha(t), \lambda(t))}{\partial \alpha} = 0 \\
  \dot{\lambda}(t) = - \frac{\partial H(t,x(t), \alpha(t), \lambda(t))}{\partial
	x}\end{gathered}$$
