For a maximization problem

$$ y = f(x_1, x_2, a) $$

where $y$ is the object to be maximized, $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the decisions we
shall to make to maximize $y$, $a$ is another parameter.

In this problem, the optimized $y$, $y^*$, is depended on value $a$. If $a$
changed, $y^*$ changes accordingly. There is a relationship between them, which
can be expressed by an implicit function.

To study how $a$ affects $y^*$, we can calculate the derivatives

$$ \frac{\partial y^*}{\partial a}.$$

The direct approach would be deriving the explicit the function $y^*(a, x_1,
x_2)$ from function $y=f(x_1, x_2, a)$, then differentiate $y^*$ with respect to
$a$.

However, the first approach must solve a maximization problem at first which may
be time-consuming.

A shortcut exists, which takes advantage of the envelope theorem. This theorem
states that to calculate $\partial y^* / \partial a$ we just need to
differentiate $y=f(x_1,x_2, a)$ with respect to $a$ while holding $x_1, x_2$ at
their optimized level $x_1^*, x_2^*$,

$$ \frac{dy^*}{da} = {\left. \frac{\partial f}{\partial a}
\right\vert}_{\{x_1=x_1^*(a), x_2 = x_2^*(a)\}}.$$
