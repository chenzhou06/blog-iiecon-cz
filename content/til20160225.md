In Nicholson's *Microeconomic Theory* the author explains why total
cost functions are concave in input prices. In the first place I was
not interested in this conclusion, because it is very obvious to
me. I was kind of taking this property of cost function for granted
since my undergraduate textbooks depict those functions in curves. It
turned out that this is just my another carelessness on study.

Actually the concavity of total cost function is not very hard to
explain.

If the firm did not change its input mix in response to changes in
wages, the cost to produce $q_0$ might be $C''$. However,

These actual costs $C(v',w,q_0)$ would fall below $C''$.
