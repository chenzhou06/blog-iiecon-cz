In Python, the attribute `__closure__` contains binding for a
function's free variable.

For instance, if we define a function named `foo` in which we again
define a function named `bar`. The function `bar` returns the value of
a variable which is defined in the function `foo` but outside of the
function `bar`. The function `foo` in the end returns the function
`bar`.

```python
def foo():
	a_variale = "a variable"
	def bar():
		return a_variable
	return bar
```

If we assign the result of `foo()` to a variable `b`, then the
function `b` should act in the same way as the function `bar`
returning `a_variable`.

```python
b = foo()
b()
#=> a variable
```

However, this variable should not be accessible outside the function
`foo`. Why would the variable `a_variable` still alive even?

The reason behind this is that a function object has a `__closure__`
attribute which contains bindings for its free variables. We can get
the content in a function's closure by `cell_contents`.

```python
b.__closure__[0].cell_contents
#=> 'a variable'
```

Since `__closure__` is a `tuple` or `None`, we should provide an index
to fetch a variable.
