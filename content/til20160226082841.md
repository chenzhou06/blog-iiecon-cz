From
[The Economist](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/02/daily-chart-17?fsrc=rss),
gold play its role in history as a "safe haven" for a long time. The
negative relation between the price of gold and economic performance
is easily observed by lots of researchers.

Research from the IMF finds bad news about economic indicators can
cause the price of gold to jump. A study by the Federal Reserve Board
confirms that when markets are volatile, gold tends to outperform.
