When we want to control the impact of culture on other subject like
economic progress, we, at least myself, usually try country fixed
effects in our regressions.

However, more and more researches on culture from economists suggest
culture may vary even within one country. Today, the paper[^1] I'm
reading uses *language fixed effects* to control the impact from
culture. This is a brilliant idea to me.
