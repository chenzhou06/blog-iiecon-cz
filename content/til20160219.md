Long time ago when I just started to learn programming, I encountered a problem
which needs me to go though all the sub directories under a parent directory to
find a certain file whose name fits a pattern. This should be a very elementary
problem. However, due to my lack of experience both in programming and in
recursively thinking, I failed to solve it.

After a period of time exposed in Haskell and Lisp, I gradually get a grip on
functional programming which demands heavily on thinking recursively. Today,
when I am browsing the source code of
[prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) which is a bundle of powerful
configuration files for Emacs, a part of its
[init.el file](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/blob/master/init.el#L71)
reminds me of the long-forgotten problem.

Here, I just implement the solution in Racket to traverse a directory and display
all file names.

```racket
;; List all files under `parent-path'
(define (traverse parent-path)
  (for ([path (directory-list parent-path)])
    (let ([name (build-path parent-path path)])
      (cond
        [(file-exists? name) (displayln name)]
        [(directory-exists? name) (traverse name)]
        [else (error "fail")]))))
```
