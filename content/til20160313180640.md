About a year ago I was learning Flask with an excellent textbook written by
Miguel Grinberg. The code in this book exploits intensively the advantage of the
module `unittest`, which is my first experience with defensive programming.

Among the skills employed in the testing code, the most fascinating module used
is `faker-factory` which can systemically generate random contents, including

* address
* barcode
* color
* company
* credit_card
* currency
* date_time
* file
* internet
* job
* person
* phone_number
* ...

Today, my long-lost pleasure associated with using `faker` emerged again to me
when I am trying to build another toy project. The surprises and delights which
come with constantly encountering new things may serve as the very impulse for
me to learn and practice programming till today.
