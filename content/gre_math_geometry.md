Congruent line segments

:   Line segments that have equal lengths are called **congruent line segments**.

Right angle

:   An angle with a measure of $90^{\circ}$ is called a **right angle**.

Acute angle

:   An angle with a measure less than $90^{\circ}$ is called an **acute angle**.

Obtuse angle

:   An angle with a measure between $90^{\circ}$ and $180^{\circ}$ is called
    an **obtuse angle**.

Polygons

:   If a polygon has $n$ sides, it can be divided into $n-2$ triangles. The sum
    of the measures of the interior angles of an $n$-sided polygon is $(n-2)(180^{\circ})$.

Perimeter

:   The sum of the lengths of its sides.

Area

:   The area of the region enclosed by the polygon.

Equilateral triangle

:   A triangle with three congruent sides is called an **equilateral triangle**.

Isosceles triangle

:   A triangle with at least two congruent sides is called an **isosceles triangle**.

Right triangle

:   A triangle with an interior right angle is called a **right triangle**. The
    side opposite the right angle is called the **hypotenuse**; the other two
    sides are called **legs**.

Pythagorean theorem

:   In a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to
    the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs.
    
    $$a^2 = b^2 + c^2$$

Parallelogram

:   A quadirlateral in which both pairs of opposite sides are parallel is called
    a **parallelogram**.

Trapezoid

:   A quadrilateral in which two opposite sides are parallel is called a **trapezoid**.

Circle

:   Given a point $O$ in a plane and a positive number $r$, the set of points
    in the plane that are a distance of $r$ units from $O$ is called a **circle**.
    The point $O$ is called the **center** of the circle and the distance $r$
    is called the $radius$ of the circle. The **diameter** of the circle is twice
    the radius.

Chord

:   Any line segment joining two points on the circle is called a **chord**.

Circumference

:   The distance around a circle is called the **circumference** of the circle,
    which is analogous to the perimeter of a polygon.

Arc

:   Given any tow points on a circle, an **arc** is the part of the circle containing
    the two points and all the points between them.

Central angle

:   A **central angle** of a circle is an angle with its vertex at the center of
    the circle. The **measure** of an arc is the measure of its central angle,
    which is the angle formed by two radii that connect the center of the circle
    to the two endpoints of the arc.

Sector

:   A **sector** of a circle is a region bounded by an arc of the circle and two
    radii.

Iscribe, Circumscribe

:   A polygon is **inscribed** in a circle if all its vertices lie on the circle,
    or equivalently, the circle is **circumscribed** about the polygon.

Concentric circles

:   Two or more circles with the same center are called **concentric circles**.
