In C++11 the standard library have a new package for regular expression. To use
this package we should include it by

```c++
#include <regex>
```

If you are using Emacs with Flycheck, you should set the variable
`flycheck-gcc-language-standard` or `flycheck-clang-language-standard` depending
on your compiler to "C++11". Otherwise, Flycheck would keep complaining.

The `regex` library provides several templates to manipulate string with regular
expression. For the sake of my laziness, I only have experience with
`regex_match` which can take a string or a vector of char and match it to a
pattern. The pattern should be claimed with `std::regex`. The basic usage would
be

```c++
std::regex e = "\\d+";
string s = "abc123";
if (std::regex_match(s,e)) {
	return "matched";
}
//=> "matched"
```

The first line initiate a regular expression, the second line is the data I am
going to search on. To get the matched results we can insert another argument to
the function so that the result would be stored in that argument.

```c++
std::smatch matched;
std::regex_match(s, matched, e);
```

If the search succeeds, we can get all matches using iterators.

```c++
for (auto pos=matched.begin(); pos != matched.end(); ++pos) {
	std::cout << *pos << std::endl;
}
```
