In macroeconomics, the conclusion about economic growth is sensitive to the form
of production function. Usually we use Cobby-Douglas production function, which
is survived after generations of economists. However, once upon a time, Harrod
and Domar in their research use Leontief production function which leads them
to a pessimistic conclusion:

>The capitalist economies would have undesirable outcomes in the form of
>perpetual increases in umemployed workers or machines.

A [note](/extra/leontief-production-function-and-harrod-domar-controversy.pdf) I take
shows how this conclusion is derived.

Also, [here](/extra/harrod-domar-controversy.html) is an interactive plot
showing the controversy in the Harrod-Domar model, which takes advantage
of [JSXGraph](http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/index.html).
