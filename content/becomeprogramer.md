Yesterday, The author of *Learn Python the Hard Way* published an
article about learning programming. He said many programmer don't
believe that many nonprogrammer knows nearly nothing to start
program. I totally agree with him on this point, because I, myself,
know nothing to program before learning it.

I started programming from the R language. Actually I had read a book
about C language years ago, but I didn't really get my hands dirty to
learn it. The book I chose for learning R wasn't focused on the language
itself, instead it mainly talk about statistics, so I failed to master
that book.

## The Head First seiry is a very good beginning

Then, I chose python to learn. At first I read *Head First Python* for
the beginning. The choice was right, that book finnally led me into
the realm of programming, even though it did not go very deep. Of
cause, It was not very clear to me how to use Python in the real
world. And I couldn't write a script on my own at that time.

## Interactive Tutorial Website is perfect for practice

We all become lazy when the impulse faded sveral days ago. I think
seldom will men keep practicing the example code all along the book.
Usually we will go thourgh the code more quickly as we get closer to
the end of the book. This is partly because we lose patience when the
passion is lost and partly because the difficulty increases along with
the process of reading.

We need a method that bored us less quickly. An interactive tutorial
website is perfect for this purpose. For going into the next learning
stage, we should type the real code in the editor the website offered.
We are forced to get our hands dirty.

However, the online tutorial is less profound than a book. It can not
provide many fatal information on how to program on your system, which
is simplified by a web interface on the website. So you should learn
programming by reading a book as a beginning. The online tutorial is
only useful for people who already have had exprience on programming.

## C is vital to understand what happened under the hood

Even though many people think C is not necessary to become a
programmer, I dicided to learn it. C made me a lot of trouble with its
pointer.  To understand its usage, I read *C the pointer* beside *ANCI
C*. However, it's not until I've read author books about C that I
started knowing how to use pointer. *ANCI C* is very tough for me.
even if I typed all the code in the book, it's still very often that I
didn't know how the code works.

During the process of learning C, I found "Learn C the Hard Way" was not
proper for a beginner who have no exprience on programming. I was
lost very soon as the book started talking about how to implement a
database, which was Greek to me.

After I felt comfortable with C, I wrote a package about matrix
calculation.  Since then, I didn't write C any longer.

I failed at learning C++ after several books, which didn't make me
much trouble.

## Functional programming is awesome

As I was learning programming, I often heard that SCIP is a great book
I must not miss. I started it and began learning Scheme. The book is
very profound and interesting, which revealed many methods in the
field of programming. That's the first time I encounted with the notion
of functional programming. However, it's overskilled for me who was just
interested in coding, and there was high chance that I had no clue about
what the meaning of the code in that book.

Not surprisingly I didn't finished SCIP. But I picked up Haskell at
the beginning of this year. I couldn't understand recursive function
as usual, but after I have read *Learn Haskell for a Great Good*
twice, I went into the realm of functional programming in the end. Of
cause, I made efforts to understand `fold`. Now I am reading
*Real World Haskell* for a thorough understanding of Haskell.

At this point I am interested in Scheme, because I want to hava a feeling
of coding in Lisp but with less complexity. I am also learning Emacs,
this journal is written in Emacs.
