The *local clustering coefficient* of a vertex in a graph quantifies
how close its neighbors are to being a [complete graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_%28graph_theory%29)[^1].

To elucidate this concept, we first introduce some handy notations to
alleviate our mind's burden.

A graph $G = (V, E)$ consist of a set of vertices $V$ and a set of
edges $E$. The neighborhood $N_i$ for a vertex $v_i$ is a set of
vertices which immediately connected with $v_i$,

$$ N_i = \{ v_j : e_{ij} \in E\}.$$

The number of vertices in the neighborhood of a vertex $v_i$ is denoted
as $|N_i|$.

Since the *local clustering coefficient* stands for the extent to
which the neighbors of a vertex form a complete graph, we can define it as

$$\frac{\text{The number of edges between the neighbors}}{\text{The
number of edges if the neighbors construct a complete graph}}.$$

The set of edges between the neighborhood of a vertex $v_i$ can be
denoted as

$$\{e_{jk}:v_j, v_k \in N_i, e_{jk} \in E\}.$$

If the neighbors indeed form a complete graph, the number of edges
between them should be

$$\frac{|N_i|(|N_i| - 1)}{2} \quad \text{in a undirected graph}.$$


Combining the last three equations yields

$$C_i = \frac{2|\{e_{jk}:v_j, v_k \in N_i, e_{jk} \in E\}|}{k_i(k_i - 1)},$$

which is the formal definition of local clustering coefficient in an
undirected graph.
