Python is known as an interpreted language. In fact, before python
executing a script file, three process must be passed before
actually interpreting[^1].

* Lexing
* Parsing
* Compiling

After these three steps, source code is translated to *code objects*
which will be handled by interpreter. The interpreter then take these
code objects and follow the instructions.

The *code objects* generated by the compiler are actually something
called *bytecode* which is not readable to most
programmers. Fortunately, Python has a module helping us to understand
them by generating bytecode explicitly in a human-readable format.

For example, there is a snippet for adding two numbers in file `add.py`.

```python
def add(a, b):
	return a + b
```

If we provide this code to `dis` module, the corresponding bytecode
will be printed.

```bash
python -m dis add.py
  2           0 LOAD_CONST               0 (<code object add at 0x7faf441770c0, file "add.py", line 2>)
			  3 LOAD_CONST               1 ('add')
			  6 MAKE_FUNCTION            0
			  9 STORE_NAME               0 (add)
			 12 LOAD_CONST               2 (None)
			 15 RETURN_VALUE
```

Very helpful for internal inspectors.
