Even though C++ is a typical imperative language, there is a method to
pass a function as an argument into another function.

There is an example from
[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_pointer).

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int add(int first, int second) {
	return first + second;
}

int subtract(int first, int second) {
	return first - second;
}

int operation(int first, int second, int (*functocall)(int, int)) {
	return (*functocall)(first, second);
}

int main() {
	int  a, b;
	int  (*plus)(int, int) = add;
	int (*minus)(int, int) = subtract;

	a = operation(7, 5, plus);
	b = operation(20, a, minus);
	cout << "a = " << a << " and b = " << b << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

In this example, two simple functions, `add` and `substract`, are
defined. The third function, `operation`, intends to use these two
functions to do operation on two integers.

A function pointer looks similar to its definition, but its name
should be inside a pair of parenthesis and an asteroid should be
placed between the first parenthesis and the function name to indicate
it is a pointer. The name of arguments in function pointer are
ignored. Only type indication remains.

To invoke a function via function pointer, we should modify the
function name to pointer form (parenthesis and asteroid), the rest are
the same.

We also can rename a function pointer. In the example above, function
pointer `add` is given a new name `plus`. `subtract` is renamed to
`minus`.

The code to rename function pointer looks like this:

```c++
int (*plus) (int, int) = add;
//    ^^^^               ^^^
//    new                old
//    name               name
```

To pass a function pointer is pretty straightforward. No extra
decoration is needed. Just use the pointer name as an argument.
