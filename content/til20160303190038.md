A point $x^*$ is a fixed point for a map $G$ if $x^* =
G(x^*)$.

There is a theorem called fixed point theorem, that if $g$ is a
continuous function $g(x) \in [a,b]$ for all $x \in [a,b]$, then $g$
has a fixed point in $[a,b]$.

Fixed point theorem can be proven by constructing a helping function

$$F(x) = g(x) - x, \quad x \in [a,b].$$

From $g(x) \in [a,b], \forall x \in [a,b]$, we know that $g(a) \ge a,
g(b) \le b$. Rewriting the two inequations in the form of $F(x)$:

$$F(a) = g(a) - a \ge 0, \quad F(b) = g(b) - b \le 0.$$

Since $F(x)$ is continuous (obviously), the intermediate value theorem
guarantees us that there exists a $c \in [a,b]$ such that

$$F(c) = 0.$$

Further, this $c$ must satisfy $g(c) - c = 0$. Finally, there must be
a fixed point $c \in [a,b]$ such that $g(c) = c$.
