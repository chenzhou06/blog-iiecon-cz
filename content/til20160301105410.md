There were (are?) seven bridges in Königsberg.

Can you find a walk through the city that across each bridge once and
only once?

This question was answered by Euler in 1736, and thereafter a new
branch of mathematics, graph theory, gradually formed.

The first step to solve this problem is extract information that
really matters.

The landmasses in the question can just be abstracted as
*vertices*. The bridges in the city just some *edges* connecting those
vertices.

Therefore, this city becomes this:

The solution lies in the number of edges a node has. Suppose there are
even numbers of edge which belong to the node $A$. So, a path comes
from another node can leave this node with occupying two edges and
other even number of edges untouched. Thus, every edge to this node
$A$ can be used once and only once. However, if a node $B$ has odd
number of edges, it is impossible for the last walk coming from other
nodes to leave this node without reusing an edge because every walk
through this node will delete 2 edges, the odd number of edges could
not satisfy this constraint.

As you can see, none of nodes in Konigsberg have even number of
edges. The answer to the question above is certainly no.

In fact, if a graph has a walk though every vertex that across each
edge once and only once then the number of odd degree vertices is
either 0 or 2.
