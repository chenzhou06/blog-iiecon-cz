A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mfk_L4Nx2ZI) on YouTube explained why
$0!=1$.

The factorial of a number $n$, which is denoted as $n!$, is equal to

$$ n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \cdots \times 2 \times 1.$$

For example $5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$. This definition
can be expressed recursively:

$$n! =
\begin{cases}
  n \times (n-1)! & \text{for } n > 0, \\
  1               & \text{for } n = 0.
\end{cases}
$$

The definition of $0!$ is counter intuitive, but can be inferred by completing a
pattern. First, the factorial of number $4$ can be expressed as
$\frac{5!}{5}$. Similarly, $3!$ equals to $\frac{4!}{4}$. Following this pattern
we can write

$$
\begin{align}
  2! & = \frac{3!}{3}, \\
  1! & = \frac{2!}{2}.
\end{align}
$$

Naturally, $0!=\frac{1!}{1} = 1$ completes this pattern. But factorial does not
make sense for negative numbers. For a negative number, say $-1$, the factorial
$(-1)!$ is $(-1) \times (-2) \times \cdots$, which never ends.
