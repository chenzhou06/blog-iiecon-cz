Genetic diversity can impact prehistoric economic development in both
directions, positive and negative.

* First, high diversity cause disarray and mistrust. When operation is
  the key to promote productivity, high diversity confines operation
  within small groups, lowering the upper bound the production can
  reach.
* At the same time, lower diversity bears less obstruction between
  people, which facilitate mass operation.
* On the other hand, higher diversity would expand society's
  production possibility frontier. Different people from different
  background tends to come up with wider horizon of invention.

Also, there are a bunch of studies conclude that the farther from the
human's cradle, East Africa, the lower the degree of genetic diversity.
Thus, the comparative economic development difference might be
explained partly by this theory.
