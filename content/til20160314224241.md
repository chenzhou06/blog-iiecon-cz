In mathematics, the symmetry of second derivatives is the alternative statement
of Young's theorem. Under general conditions interchanging the order of
taking *partial derivatives* of a function

$$ f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n). $$

If the first-order derivatives of $f$ with respect of $x_i$ is $f_i$, with
respect of $x_j$ is $f_j$. Then the second-order derivatives $f_{ij}$ satisfy

$$ f_{ij} = f_{ji}. $$

This symmetry is analogical to climbing a mountain where you can go east a mile
then go north 1 mile, which is the same as go north 1 mile first then go east.

The symmetry do require the function have differentiable partial
derivatives. This condition is called Clairaut's theorem.
