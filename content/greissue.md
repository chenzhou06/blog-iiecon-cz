## Outline of the Example Article From ETS

Before the Industrial Revolution, the use of tools allowed people to move ever
closer together.

However, when most of the production today are mechanized . It looks like people
act as cogs in the technological machine.

Start to doubt the benefits of the technology.

Ambiguous benefits of the technology:

* Positive:
	1. Making work more efficient.
	2. Knitting the world together.
	3. Some visionaries.
* Negative:
	1. Introducing spiritual crisis. We know a lot of people, but we have few
	real friends. We can communicate more frequently than ever via the Internet,
	but the distance between our hearts may be extended longer than before.

Which I believe:

Progress in technology should free people from tedious work, sparing then time
for creative activities, such as art. Nowadays, technology consumes our free time.

## Useful Expression

### Vocabulary
nomadic, mechanize, cog, unravel, queasy, spiritual crisis, the relative merits
of technology

### Sentences
>The newest technologies, we fear, are making us flat as our screens, turning us
into streams of bits of interchangeable data.

>Our newest technology does not give use more free time; it consumes our free time.

## Writing Practice

One who lives in the modern civilization is fortunate in the sense that she/he
has more interesting things to do in their spare time. If that person lived in
centuries ago, he/she would almost certainly be occupied by tedious work to make
a living, unless he/she was born in a very wealthy family. Even the formal work
today are much easier than before due to the advance of technology.

However, some argue that what the technology brought not only the improvement
in convenience and efficient but also the increasing loneliness. Although it's
broadly admitted that technology knits people closer than ever. The whole earth
becomes a village. A person can keep in touch with friends at the other side of
the globe as long as they have access to the Internet. It's true that we know
a lot of people. Facebook and Twitter incessantly inform us their recent activities.
As the ways of transferring information become easier and easier, torrents of
information are drowning us. Our attention are distracted to trivial affairs.
We know more, but love less. Actually, at the bottom of our hearts, loneliness
is increasing. And yet...

I am a little queasy about this view. People in the past were no less lonely than
the people today. Before the Industrial Revolution, people must work much harder
and spend most of the lift so they can barely make a living. Their social
network are limited to the work field. Seldom chances that they can make friends
out of the neighborhood. It seems that at that time, people intended having more
friendship last for lifetime than today. However, is it much lonelier that
a person is limited to a region for most of their life, and have no access to
the world outside, interacting with people totally different from the local
people?

Technologies indeed make some of our friendship shallowed, but it also provide
opportunities for us to know people who share the same ideals with us. Technology
might make fewer friends can walk with us till the end of life, but the joy is
no less, even more, than the past when we are together with friends.
