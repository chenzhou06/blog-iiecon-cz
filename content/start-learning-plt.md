Today I finally started learning programming language theory. The
textbook I chose is *Foundations of Programming Languages* by Kent
D. Lee. In this textbook, the author shows us how to implement a simple
Python VM in C++. Even though the content dedicated to that VM is
limited, the actual source code is not too intimidating. With the help
of the clues mentioned in the textbook, I shall form an overview on
how to write a virtual machine.

I plan to write notes in `org mode` with Emacs and scrutinize all code
by typing them again. After that, I want to implement this virtual
machine in Rust as a method to learn this new language.
