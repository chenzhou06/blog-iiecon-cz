I have been reading a paper about Sino-Japanese war's effect on the
investment and trade between these two countries. In these paper,
several conclusions are made:

1. In the aspect of investment, if a Chinese region (province) is
damaged more severely in the war, the investment from Japanese to
their enterprises are decreased more significant. About one percent of
civil casualties would cost 23.3% contemporary investment in 2001.
Also, the number of Japanese company would be less compared with other
foreign countries. The first year that Japanese enter a region where
civil casualties is high would be late as well.
2. In respect to trade, if a Chinese region suffered more during the
war, this region would conduct less import from Japan. Meanwhile, the
export from this region to Japan would not change, so the aggregate
trade value with Japan would decrease.

This paper 

The conclusion is not at odds with our intuition, but there is a gap
between what the estimating specification and the mechanism the
authors thought behind this phenomenon--even though we can conclude
that the civil casualties would have a long-term effect on economic
relationship between China and Japan, we could not say a conflict half
century ago would directly impact people's behavior. The author tell
in this paper that the war memories and hostility pass down for
generations so that a region where hit heavily by Japanese army would
bear animosity to Japanese even now. Also, the fact that some Japanese
politician try to conceal and whitewash their invasion intensify
hostility in China.
